## Cache Storage

We offer two methods of storage for Msal, `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.  Our recommendation is to use `sessionStorage` because it is more secure in storing tokens that are acquired by your users, but `localStorage` will give you Single Sign On accross tabs and user sessions.  We encourage you to explore the options and make the best decision for your application.
