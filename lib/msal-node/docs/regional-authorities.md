# Enabling regional authorities

To increase the reliability, availability and performance of Azure, regionalization aims to keep all trafic inside a geographical area. For example, if an app needs to fetch data from Key Vault in WestUs2, all the traffic this entails - including MSAL generated traffic - should stay in WestUs2.

A few important notes about regional authorities:

- Access tokens are the same, irrespective of the region they came from

- A token obtained for one region is valid for the non-regional endpoint (tokens for "westus2.login.microsoft.com " are the same as tokens for "login.microsotonline.com "). And vice-versa. It's the same token, minus one claim called rh

> NOTE: This feature is currently only available for the client credential flow.

## Confguration
To configure your application to use regional authorities, you a required to provide a region in the `azureRegion` field in the client credential request body.

```js
var msal = require('@azure/msal-node');

const config = {
    auth: {
        clientId: "<CLIENT_ID>",
        authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>",
        clientSecret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
    }
};

// Create msal application object
const cca = new msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(config);

const clientCredentialRequest = {
    scopes: ["<SCOPE_1>, <SCOPE_2>"],
    azureRegion: "REGION_NAME" // Specify the region you will deploy your application to here. E.g. "westus2"
};

cca
    .acquireTokenByClientCredential(clientCredentialRequest)
    .then((response) => {
        // Handle a successful authentication 
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Handle a failed authentication 
    });
```

> NOTE: If you provide the value `"TryAutoDetect"` in the `azureRegion` field, the msal library which will try to discover the region the application has been deployed to and use that region. If no region is auto discovered the library will fall back to using the global authority.

## Sample
You can find a working sample of this feature in the client-credentials [sample](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/samples/msal-node-samples/client-credentials)
